		<h2>Bio</h2>
		<p class="intro">At the University of Maryland, College Park's Computer Science Program, I gained a strong foundation in Computer Science.
			Since then I have worked professionally at the company Zynga, doing full stack work on both games and internal tools.
			I have also worked with Android development, both during my time at Zynga and after.
		</p>
		<p class="intro">
			In the Winter of 2014, I finished Android training through the CodePath, and it is a technology I wish to continue with.
			In addition to Android and Java, I have additional interests in programming technologies, including game programming, 
			user-interface programming, C and C++, web languages (HTML, JavaScript, etc.), and computer graphics.
